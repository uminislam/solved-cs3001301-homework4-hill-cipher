Implementation

5/31 lecture have explained the Encryption and Decryption using matrix inverse.

Please implement it and submit the results with code. The given key matrix is [17, 17, 5 ; 21, 18, 21 ; 2, 2, 19] , and plaintext is “paymoremoney”. You have to first generate the ciphertext and then plaintext from the ciphertext. You can use C/C++/Java/Python/Matlab or any other language, but you can not use any predefined inverse function directly to find the inverse of the matrix.

<ul>

 <li>handwritten use the Gauss-Jordan Elimination method to find the inverse of the matrix [17, 17, 5 ; 21, 18, 21 ; 2, 2, 19].</li>

</ul>
